Malware detection of URLs consists of four types of categories of malware in the dataset.
Requirements:
2.1 = urllib or urllib.parse
2.2=spacy
2.3=pandas
2.4=seaborn, matplotlib, plotly
2.5=scikit-learn
2.6=tensorflow
Algorithms:
9.1=SVM
9.2=Random Forest
9.3=LSTM

The data size is too large, so by using Pandas I reduced some rows; the urls were extracted into domains: abnormal url, is_secure url,is_shortened url, has_ip_address url. These values are stored.
in the format of boolean values and also digits, letters, and columns.
